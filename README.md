in the master file should contain the membership number, first name, last name, school, state,email,
year joined, code for  active/non-active, and amount owed.

Create a report that will produce a list of members by state from the master file that has the member number,
member name, year joined, grade in school, and amount owed. Include only the members owing a balance.

The report footer should include the total number of non-active members, total number of active members, 
total number of members owing, and the amount owed.Have an option to view or print the report, allowing
for 50 detail lines per page and at the end of the report, with the footer information described above. Create a 
report that lists all seniors and their email addresses, sorted by state.
Have an option to view, print, or export to an .xls file. The design concepts of the master file, 
update program, membership report, and email report are left to the competitors.
